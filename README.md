Step1: use logistic regression with all numerical data to evaluate the cross-validation scores on training datasets, on the
task of predicting stars. The performance is unsatisfying: only around 40% accuracy. Will use pytorch deep neural network
framework to produce a better baseline for this part. Another goal is to examine what makes a review positive or negative,
baseline can be some traditional NLP models.
